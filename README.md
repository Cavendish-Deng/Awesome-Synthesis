# Awesome Sound Design [![](https://cdn.rawgit.com/sindresorhus/awesome/d7305f3/media/badge.svg)](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome)
A curated list of awesome synth design tutorials and resources. Many of these are specific to a single synthesizer, but can easily be adapted to other synthesizers, or synthesis environments (e.g. PD, SuperCollider, etc).

**Pull requests welcome!**

## General Tutorials
Name | Synthesizer | Description 
-----| ----- | --------- 
[Synth Secrets](https://github.com/micjamking/synth-secrets) | Any | A legendary tutorial series by Gordon Reid on the secrets of synthesis. Highly recommended.
[Thor Demystified](https://www.propellerheads.se/blog/thor-demystified-1-the-analogue-oscillator) | The first of a 17 part series by Gordon Reid on the Thor synthesizer. This is very much a companion to Synth Secrets, but with the advantage that you can hear what everything is supposed to sound like.
[Synthesis Workshop](https://rhordijk.home.xs4all.nl/G2Pages/index.htm)|Nord Modular G2|A decent and short introduction to a wide range of synthesis techniques by Rob Hordijk
[Nord Modular Workshops](http://electro-music.com/nm_classic/015_workshops/Clavia/NordModularWorkshops&Threads/WerkMap/WorkShops/)|Nord Modular G2|Links to various workshops run by Rob Hordijk. Hard to follow on other synthesizer, but some real gems

-----| ----- | ------------
[The Book of Bad Ideas V2](https://www.infinitesimal.eu/modules/images/5/5e/The_book_of_bad_ideas_V2.pdf) | Modular and Eurorack | A cookbook of various ideas and experiments to try with your modular environment.
[Advanced Programming Techniques for Modulars](https://www.cim.mcgill.ca/~clark/nordmodularbook/nm_book_toc.html)|Nord Modular| Very sophisticated discussion of a huge range of synthesis techniques from Rob Hordijk

## FM Synthesis
